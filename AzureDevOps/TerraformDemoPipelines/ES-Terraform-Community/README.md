# ES-Terraform-Community Example Pipelines

This folder contains example YAML files for deploying Terraform with Azure DevOps.

This relates to the video demo and instructions provided here [https://jacktracey.co.uk/terraform-with-azure-devops](https://jacktracey.co.uk/terraform-with-azure-devops) on my blog.

You can import these pipelines by following the guidance here [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/clone-import-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/clone-import-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

> **IMPORTANT:** These pipelines are provided as examples only and should be reviewed before using in a production environment!

> These were exported by using this awesome tool [Yamlizr - Azure DevOps Designer-to-YAML Pipeline Conversion Tool](https://github.com/f2calv/yamlizr)
